## üé® Design System - Marathon Cyberpunk Aesthetic

### Color Palette (CSS Custom Properties)
```css
:root {
  --primary-accent: #00ffff;      /* Neon cyan */
  --secondary-accent: #ff0080;    /* Neon magenta */
  --success-accent: #00ff41;      /* Electric green */
  --void-black: #000000;          /* True black background */
  --void-white: #ffffff;          /* Pure white accents */
  --surface-glass: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);  /* Dark glass surfaces */
  --glow-primary: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3);  /* Cyan glow effects */
}
```

### Visual Principles
- **Graphic Realism**: Marathon-inspired utilitarian sci-fi aesthetics
- **Hard Geometry**: Angular clip-paths and geometric shapes
- **Scan Line Textures**: CSS repeating-linear-gradient overlays throughout
- **Neon Glow Effects**: Drop-shadow filters instead of text-shadow
- **Typography**: Bold, all-caps utilitarian fonts with increased letter-spacing

  size: { width: number; height: number };
  isMinimized: boolean; zIndex: number;
}

// Main app state
const [windows, setWindows] = useState<WindowData[]>([]);
const [activeApp, setActiveApp] = useState('Finder');
const [highestZIndex, setHighestZIndex] = useState(1000);
```

---

## üîß Common Development Patterns

### Window Operations
```typescript
// Create new window with varied positioning (50-180px from top)
const openWindow = (windowConfig) => {
  const position = generateWindowPosition(windows.length);
  const newZIndex = highestZIndex + 1;
  // ... window creation logic
};

// Update any window property
const updateWindow = (id: string, updates: Partial<WindowData>) => {
  setWindows(prev => prev.map(w => w.id === id ? { ...w, ...updates } : w));
};
```

### Touch Event Handling Pattern
```typescript
const handlePointerDown = useCallback((e: React.MouseEvent | React.TouchEvent) => {
  const clientX = 'touches' in e ? e.touches[0].clientX : e.clientX;
  const clientY = 'touches' in e ? e.touches[0].clientY : e.clientY;
  // ... unified touch/mouse handling
}, [dependencies]);
```

### Development Server Management
**IMPORTANT**: Always stop existing dev servers before starting new ones to avoid port conflicts and resource issues.

#### Proper Development Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Check for running dev servers (Windows)
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
netstat -ano | findstr :5174
netstat -ano | findstr :5175

# 2. Kill existing servers if found (use PID from netstat)
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F

# 3. Start fresh dev server
npm run dev

# 4. For testing builds before deployment
npm run build        # Test production build
npm run preview       # Preview production build locally
```

#### Common Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server (stop others first!)
npm run build        # Production build for deployment testing
npm run preview      # Preview production build locally
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript checking
npm run lint         # Code linting (if available)
```

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches for major changes
- Descriptive commits with Claude Code attribution
- Automatic Vercel deployment on push to main

## üí° AI Assistant Notes

### When Working on This Project:
- **Always maintain** the Marathon cyberpunk aesthetic (neon cyan/magenta, hard geometry)
- **Test thoroughly** on both desktop and mobile (touch events are critical)
- **Performance first** - multiple visual layers require optimization
- **Preserve functionality** - visual changes should never break existing features
- **Use existing patterns** - follow established component architecture and state management

### Development Server Best Practices:
- **CRITICAL**: Always check for and stop existing dev servers before starting new ones
- **Use netstat commands** to find running servers on ports 5173-5179
- **Kill processes properly** using `taskkill /PID <PID> /F` to avoid resource conflicts
- **Test builds locally** with `npm run build` before pushing to avoid deployment failures
- **Use npm run preview** to test production builds locally

### Key Files to Check First:
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application state and window management
- `src/index.css` - Color system and global styles
- `src/components/Dock.tsx` - Command interface and app launching
- `src/components/Window.tsx` - Window behavior and touch handling

### Testing Checklist:
- Window dragging works on both mouse and touch
- Dock buttons show active states correctly
- iPod video playbook and physical controls function
- Mobile dock visibility and safe area handling
- Visual effects performance on various devices

### Troubleshooting Common Issues:

#### Vercel Deployment Not Updating:
1. **Check TypeScript errors**: Run `npm run build` locally first
2. **Verify git push**: Ensure changes are actually pushed to GitHub
3. **Check Vercel logs**: Look for build failures in Vercel dashboard
4. **Branch mismatch**: Ensure Vercel is deploying from correct branch (main)

#### Multiple Dev Servers Running:
```bash
# Find running servers
netstat -ano | findstr :517

# Kill specific process
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F

# Kill all Node processes (nuclear option)
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
```

#### Console Warnings (runtime.lastError):
- Usually caused by browser extensions, not our code
- Enhanced cleanup in visual effects components should minimize these
- Can be ignored if functionality works correctly

#### Build Failures:
- Always test `npm run build` locally before pushing
- Check for TypeScript strict mode errors
- Ensure all imports and dependencies are correct
